Visual Studio 2015 Project for a sample OpenGL app that is implemented in C++ using the OpenGL library. It allows you to browse and see the contents (in decimal, hex, char and binary formats) of every address in the process address space. It also color maps every byte in memory so we visually get an idea about the most common byte values. A lot of variables (x86-x64, physical vs. virtual memory, etcâ€¦) could affect the way we visualize memory, so they are described in detail in blog post linked below.
